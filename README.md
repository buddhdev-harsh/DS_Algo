<h1>Few things to consider while contributing to this repo.</h1>
  <br>
    
    1. keep your code clean.
    2. Use OOP concepts to implement.
    3. try to implement it by yourself, it's okay to do it wrong but it's not okay to ctrl C+V.
    4. test your code with edge cases.
    5. ask for code review if unsure.
